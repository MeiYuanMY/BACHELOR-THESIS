<h1 id="section1"> Abstract </h1>
<br>  </br>
The approach of machine learning has already been applied to logo design. This study aims to explore how a logo generator creates logos with machine learning. Aiming to uncover the mechanisms of machine learning, a reverse study of the logo generating program Brandmark is conducted by analyzing correlations between inputs and outputs. The results obtained in this research uncover the mechanisms of logo generators and reveal three factors responsible for the low design quality of Brandmark’s logos: inaccuracy of icon creation, singular correlations between inputs and outputs and lack of quality evaluation. Lastly, possible measures for addressing these weak points are suggested.

<h1 id="section2"> 1.Introduction </h1>
<br> </br>
One of the earliest logos in logo history was the logo of the English William Bass brewery, whose products have been displaying a red triangle since around 1875. The Bass Triangle was the first ever trademark to be registered in the United Kingdom and is thus the most strongly protected in the market (Remington, Müller and Wiedemann, 2018, p.11). About 150 years later, logos still play a vital role in the capital market. Currently, a logo is a crucial factor in shaping a firm’s public image (Kamekura, 1988). A logo is a distinctive symbol representing a company (Adams, 2008), and its goal is to represent the company’s culture and values. In order to achieve these goals, logo creation is a complex activity requiring knowledge in communication, marketing, graphics, sociology, psychology, design, and the science of colors etc. (Adir, Adir and Pascu, 2014). The logo designer is demanded to interpret the full meaning of the value of the company and express it through one symbol (Remington, Müller and Wiedemann, 2018, p.57). This work requires a high level of abstraction and artistic talent. Thus, it has always been considered that a successful logo design can only be achieved by humans. Indeed, most of the time, when start-ups want to bring their business or products to the market, they will find a designer or design agency to create a logo for their company – an assignment that can take many months and cost large sums of money. 
Today, start-ups have another option that offers greater efficiency and a lower price. This option is the use of logo generators that are based on a ‘Modern Approach’, meaning “Artificial Intelligence” (Russell and Norvig, 2016). Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans through machine learning. Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Samuel, 1959). The process of learning begins with observations of data, such as examples, direct experience, in order to look for patterns in data and make better predictions in the future (Expertsystem.com, 2019). The approach of machine learning has already been widely applied to logo design. This study aims to explore how a logo generator creates logos with machine learning. In order to gain a better understanding of computerized logo design, it is important to realize how logo design generally works. Design is the method of putting form and content together (Rand, 2017). Logo design organizes the basic composing elements and forms them as a complex identification system. When successfully done, customer expectations are usually met. In a logo generator program, the user is just required to enter a few words, and the program will automatically generate thousands of logos. That means that a machine perceptron creates logos from the information that is given by users. A logo generator creates logos by processing input-data into a combination of forms and contents, seemingly predicting user expectations. This paper aims to uncover the mechanisms of logo generating programs by conducting a reverse study of the logo generating program “Brandmark”. This program applies the latest algorithm of machine learning, incorporating convolutional nets, word embeddings and Convolutional Neural Network (GNN) (Qiao, 2017). The correlation between the outputs of and the inputs in Brandmark will be analyzed because in neural network design, machine learning occurs by finding the connection between input and output (Dormehl, 2016). The goals of this study are two-fold: deconstructing Brandmark’s working mechanisms to help designers understand machine learning and analyzing its problems to propose possible improvements for logo generators.

<h1 id="section3"> 2.Literature Review</h1>
	<br> </br>
Since modernist logos appeared in 1920, a number of studies have sought to investigate logo-related elements. Adir, Adir and Pascu (2012) demonstrated in their research published in the Journal ‘Social and Behavioral Sciences’ that logos serve contacting, explanatory, denotative, identifying, signifying, transforming and aesthetic functions. A logo has a significant impact on brand building, positioning, and competition for modern enterprises because it demonstrates how a corporation presents itself and communicates with the public. Logos combine core visual elements (typeface, color, symbol) and an editorial element (layout) to form a unique and cohesive message (Adams, Morioka and Stone, 2006, p18). According to a survey conducted by Bresciani and Del Ponte (2017), most customers group logos into three categories: brand icon and/or name, colored logos, and black logos. Logos composed of an icon plus a brand name are perceived as significantly more attractive than logos made of one component only. Influenced by the Bauhaus design movement, the new aesthetic discipline of commercial art designs, logos as abstract shapes and skillfully intermingles them with geometric forms (Remington, Müller and Wiedemann, 2018, p.11). The geometric shapes arouse certain associations and therefore suggest an image of the company: circle – perfection, balance; square – stability, power; rectangle – duration, progress; ellipse – continuing, searching; triangle – harmony, dynamic, or forward looking; spiral – advancement, detaching; sphere – perfection, finality; pyramid – integration, convergence; cube – stability, integrity (Adir, Adir and Pascu, 2012). In addition to incorporating geometric forms, a logo will reach its maximum potential by using a signature color. Color defines the appearance and character of a logo and, just like geometries, arouses certain associations: red means confidence, youth, and power, orange expresses friendliness, warmth, and energy, and black is associated with reliability, sophistication, and experience. A logo designer is aware of the fact that color can make a logo memorable or forgettable (Rider, 2009, p.19). Just like geometries and colors, typefaces affect the overall impression as well. The typeface creates impressions such as pleasing, engaging, reassuring, and prominent. The current aesthetic design principles suggest that logo designers select a typeface with the use of six underlying design dimensions: elaborate, harmony, natural, flourish, weight, and compressed (Henderson, Giese and Cote, 2004). The understanding of these core elements and construction rules of logos made it possible to apply Artificial Intelligence, more precisely the method of machine learning, to the field of logo design. Machine learning uses an explicit set of rules to describe a program’s possible behavior: a machine learning system looks for patterns within sets of example behavior in order to produce an approximate representation of rules themselves (Hebron, 2016). From this approach, a machine perceptron masters the pattern of logo design after data training. With the constituents of logo design, namely color scheme, icons and font, theses elements and input data will be processed in CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), a specific type of artificial neural network has an input layer, an output layer and various hidden layers, some of these layers are convolutional, which was inspired by the organization of the visual brain cortex (Saha, 2018). Then countless logos are created by the logo generator. More impressively, through reinforcement learning, the logo generator constantly updates its parameters in its algorithm model and seeks to improve its outputs.

<h1 id="section3">3.Material and Method</h1>
<br></br>

The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of how a machine perception generates logos. The research takes the form of a reverse study, which means it will reveal design principles by starting with the results. The program generates a large number of logos based on the information the user enters. In order to explore the mechanism of logo generators, the correlation between outputs (logos) and inputs (information entered by the user) will be analyzed. This study concentrates on the logo generating program Brandmark. Brandmark has generated logos with deep learning for more than 108,704 users (Qiao, 2017). The research will be divided into three parts: 1. the observation of the work process of Brandmark; 2. the disassembly of the basic components of Brandmark; 3. the analysis of the correlation between inputs and outputs. 
<br></br>

<h4>3.1 Working Process of Brandmark</h4>
Brandmark is a desktop program for logo generation. It requires the user to provide basic information of their company and then generates a huge amount of logos for the user to choose from. Its work process can be divided into the following steps:
-	entering the brand name and tagline (optional) 
The brand name has to comprise at least two letters but does not have a limitation of maximum letters or words. 
-	entering brand keywords
The user is required to describe their own brand in keywords. The entry can range from just one word to a number of sentences.
-	choosing the color style 
After the brand name and keywords have been entered, Brandmark lets the user select at least one color style. There are four options: clean, simple; vibrant, intense; warm, natural; grey, neutral.
-	generating logos
Within a few seconds after entering the above information, a vast amount of logos is generated. They are displayed horizontally on the screen, with one logo shown in the center. By pressing the left and right buttons, the next and previous logos can be seen.
-	selecting mode 
At the same time as the logo displays, there is a mode option on the top of the screen with five options. The default option is “all”, and the other four options are: modern, vintage, playful, handwriting.
For each logo, there is a buy button. By clicking on this button, the user can purchase this logo. In addition, there are four other buttons: save, edit, font and share. By clicking the edit button, the user can perform simple editing on the text, icon, and color of the logo, such as changing the icon, zooming in or out of the elements, or changing the color.

<h4>3.2 Basic Components of Brandmark</h4>
A logo consists of different parts, mainly font, color, layout and icon. Brandmark uses machine learning to learn which combinations are most harmonic. It specifically uses convolutional nets, word embeddings and GNN (Qiao, 2017). By observing the settings and code of Brandmark, it can be concluded that the model of program is mainly composed of two blocks: 
Logo=BrandMark (Title, Tagline, Icon, Background)
ColorScheme (Main color, Background color)
In addition to this, through the analysis of the required input-information from users, the following input-model can be concluded: Input = (variable name, variable keyword, variable color, variable mode).
Then the algorithm model processes the data and produces the logos.

<h4>3.3 Correlation Analysis between Inputs and Outputs</h4>
This reverse study begins with the generated result: logos. The content a logo includes icon, color, font and layout. Since a logo is composed of these four main elements (icon, color, font and layout), the analysis is divided into these four parts. In order to generate a logo, Brandmark requires the user to enter four parameters into a free text field. These parameters are: variable name, variable keyword, variable color and variable mode. In order to find out how a logo generator processes the data and creates logos, the connection between outputs und inputs must be analyzed. The method of this analysis is a correlation analysis, which is a statistical method used to evaluate the strength of relationship between two quantitative variables (Franzese and Iuliano, 2019, p. 706). The correlation analysis is composed of four parts: icon, color, font and layout. Next, each section will have a correlation analysis of the inputs with four variables. The analysis model is shown in the following figure (Analysis Model).
<img class="img-xys" src="content/img/2.jpg">
Analysis Model
In order to produce a richer understanding of the research data, this analysis is designed as a triangulation approach with a combination of quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative research means that this analysis needs to obtain a large amount of data, i.e., a large number of generated logos. For each research sample, two hundred logos will be objectively collected. To gather each research sample of logos, its generation occurs under the specific condition that for the particular variable that is studied, different parameters are given, while the variables that are not studied remain identical. Qualitative research denotes the data analysis with observation and description, to bring depth of understanding to certain correlations. In addition to this, according to typology, logos can be divided into iconic, logotype, and complex logos (Adir, Adir and Pascu, 2014). For different focuses of analysis, the typology of logos will change. For example, if an icon will be analyzed, logos in the style of iconic will be collected more often. In contrast to this, if font will be analyzed, logos in the style of logotype will appear more frequently. 

According to the analysis model described above, the correlation analysis was carried out as follows:
<h5>3.3.1 Factors determining the Icon</h5>
a. Variable Brand Name 
In order to study whether the icon is determined by the brand name, two different brand name parameters have been chosen: Matrix Design and Focus Design. The parameters for keyword, mode and color were the same in both cases, namely creativity, vibrant, intense and all. The resulting icons shown in figure 1 and figure 2 in the appendix to this bachelor thesis are basically the same, which means that there is no direct correlation between the variable brand name and the icon created.

b. Variable Keyword
To examine the correlation between keyword and icon, two different keywords have been chosen: creativity and technology. In both cases, the name parameter was Matrix, the mode parameter was all and the color parameter was vibrant, intense. The resulting logos in figures 3 and 4 in the appendix contain completely different icons, which means that the input variable keyword and icon have a strong direct correlation.

c. Variable Color
In order to examine the correlation between color and icon, logos were generated with four different color parameters: clean, simple; vibrant, intense; warm, natural; grey, neutral. In all four cases the keyword was creativity, the mode was all and the name was Matrix Design. The resulted icons (shown in figures 5-8) are almost the same, which means that there is no direct correlation between the variable color and icon.

d. Variable Mode
The fourth part deals with different mode parameters: modern, vintage, playful, and handwriting. The keyword-, mode- and name-parameters are the same. The resulted icons (shown in figures 9-12) do not display any visible differences, which means that there is no correlation between the variable mode and icon.

<h5>3.3.2 Factors determining the Color</h5>
Two colors can be found in a logo, the subject color and the background color. These two colors should be considered as a unit because when viewers see a logo, they do not distinguish the subject color from the background color. Instead they look at the color of the logo as a whole. Therefore, this study will regard logo color as a whole.

a. Variable Brand Name
First, in order to find the correlation between the variables name and color, two sets of words were entered into the name parameter: one set of words with a strong color tendency, Black Design and Red Design, and one set of words with strong emotional inclination, Joy Design and Sad Design. The parameters of the other three variables are identical. The generated results are shown in figures 13-16. In terms of color there is almost no difference between the Black Design and the Red Design. The color of the logos Joy Design and the Sad Design, however, are visibly different. It can be concluded that names with emotional inclinations have a strong influence on the logo color whereas names containing a color tendency do not.

b. Variable Keyword
Two sets of keywords with completely different attributes were given: joy, playful, open opposed to sad, serious, close. In the generated logos (shown in figures 17 and 18), there is no significant difference in color. Therefore, it can be concluded that there might not be a direct correlation between keywords and colors.
   
c. Variable Color
In this section, the same brand name, keyword and mode were used. Afterwards logos are generated based on four different color parameters: clean, simple; vibrant, intense; warm, natural; grey, neutral. The logo sets seen in resulting figures (figures 19-22) are completely different from each other. Accordingly, it can be inferred that the variable color has a crucial influence on the color style of the logo.

d. Variable Mode
In this section, the same brand name, keyword and color were set, and different data sets were generated according to the modes: modern, vintage, playful, and handwriting, as shown in the figures 23-26. It can be observed that there is no visible difference in color among the generated results. Therefore, it appears that there is no direct correlation between the variable mode and color.

<h5>3.3.3 Factors determining the Font</h5>
a. Variable Brand Name
In order to see whether the variable brand name is directly influences the font, the conductor of this experiment selected four descriptive or symbolic names. These are: Focus Design, Mountain Design, Heavy Design, and Light Sushi. From the observation of data which are presented in the figures 27-30, there is no association between the font and brand name of the logo.
 
b. Variable Keyword
For this set of comparison, brand name, color style, and mode were identical, but two sets of completely opposite keywords were given: light, thin, and triangle, compared to heavy, thick and circle. In the resulting logos, the font does not appear different in two samples, as shown in the figures 31 and 32. Therefore, it can be concluded that there might not be a correlation between font and variable keyword.

c. Variable Color
In order to test whether different color styles affect the font, different color variables have been chosen – namely clean, simple; vibrant, intense; warm, natural; grey, neutral –, whereas brand name, keyword and mode remained identical. The generated logo data is as shown in the figures 33-36. The data of the four groups does not show any significant correlation between font and color. 

d. Variable Mode
Here, the data was generated with different modes (modern, vintage, playful and handwriting) and the same settings of brand name, keyword and color. It can be seen in figures 37-40 that the fonts of the four sets are different from each other. In the modern mode, the fonts are mostly sans serif typeface. In the vintage mode, the font is primarily serif typeface. In the mode playful, the fonts tend to be more decorative. Further, in the handwriting mode, the fonts are mostly in a hand-drawn style. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a strong correlation between the variable mode and the font.

<h5>3.3.4 Factors determining the Layout</h5>
a. Variable Brand Name
Four names with different lengths were given: MD, Matrix Design, Matrix Design Studio, and Beijing Matrix Design Studio. Sorted by different lengths of names and other identical parameters, the generated logo data is shown in the figures 41-44. They show that the length of a name significantly influences the layout, which proves that the variable brand name has a distinct correlation with the layout.

b. Variable Keyword
In this section, with otherwise identical variables, four keywords with completely different tendencies were given: oblique, vertical, horizontal and square. The resulting data is shown in the figures 45-48. It can still be concluded that the keyword seems to have an impact only on the icon. It does not affect the layout.

c. Variable Color
This set aims to find out if different color styles will affect the layout. The color variables selected were: clean, simple; vibrant, intense; warm, natural; grey, neutral. The other variables were identical. The layouts in four samples (shown in figures 49-52) do not appear to be different from each other. It can be concluded that there is no correlation between layout and color style.

d. Variable Mode
In this setting the logo generator was provided with different mode parameters, namely modern, vintage, playful, and handwriting, and the same keyword-, mode-, and name-parameters. There are no substantial differences in the layouts of the resulting logo groups (figures 53-56) which means that there is no direct correlation between the variable mode and layout. 


<h1 id="section5">4.Result and Discussion</h1>
<br></br>
<h3>4.1 Result</h3>
The result of the correlation analysis process in the previous section can be summarized as follows:
-	icons of the generated logos are determined by the variable keyword
-	the generated color is, on one hand, affected by the color style, but also by the attributes of the brand name
-	mode selection has a significant impact on the font of generated logos
-	the layout of the logo is determined by the brand name, particularly the length of brand name

The entire work process of Brandmark can be divided into three layers, as shown in the following figure: the input layer, the hidden layer and the output layer.

 
The user supplies the data in an input layer, the input data and the data stored in the background of the program are processed in a hidden layer and, finally, the program outputs are presented in an output layer. 

After the analysis, the mechanisms of generative programs with machine leaning can be concluded as follows:
- Defining the target
For instance, designing logos. A logo consists of the elements, icon, color, font, and layout;
- Letting the machine perceptron understand ‘what is a logo’, and its data form.
In order to design an algorithm model, a program must learn a large amount of tagged logo data. Through training, the machine has mastered which elements make up a logo and how they are combined. Through machine learning, it establishes a generative algorithm model for logo design.
- Creating a data base of design elements
The data base for the logo generator incorporates a large amount of design element data, such as icon, color scheme, font.
- Generation process
After the layout frame has been given by the program, the generation system matches multiple corresponding elements according to the inputs that are provided by the user. Then it puts the elements into the framework, and finally combines these elements in a layout frame and generates logos. 

<h3>4.2 Discussion</h3>
From understanding how a logo generator works, it can be stated that a logo generator poses a challenge to human designers as a fierce competitor equipped with data and algorithms opposed to inspiration and intuition. The most powerful strength of Brandmark lies in the data processing and its combination with a large amount of stored design elements. Its workflow is actually a data matching process: By matching an icon with a keyword, a brand name and different fonts, it “translates” the designer’s intuitive behavior into data computation. With the advantage of vast data and computing power, Brandmark can generate tens of thousands of logos in a few seconds. This efficiency exceeds by far the abilities of a single human designer. Because a logo generator makes the task of logo design easy and affordable for the customer, entrepreneurs do not need a large budget, nor do they need to find a human designer anymore. More importantly, the most significant capability of machine learning lies in learning. A machine perceptron constantly learns from the user’s behavior, day after day, refining its algorithms and generating better logos. It can clearly be seen that the logo quality has improved considerably from the first to the second version of Brandmark. One has to wonder what kind of logos will be generated by logo generators like Brandmark in five years from now.

However, according to Brandmark’s founder, Brandmark is still immature at this stage and cannot replace human designers (Qiao, 2017). Indeed, there are rarely any amazing masterpieces in the tens of thousands of generated logos – but why? This paper suggests that three factors are responsible for the low design quality of Brandmark’s logos:
<h5>4.2.1 Inaccuracy of Icon Creation</h5>
In logo design, the icon plays a crucial role. In a logo generator, icons are strongly related to keywords, and are selected from a stored icon dataset. However, an icon generated this way is often inaccurate and does not exactly convey the culture and value of the company. One reason for that is that the keyword is often not precise. Users of logo generators usually select the keywords in a relatively short time and do not reflect their keywords carefully enough. Therefore, the keywords often fail to accurately convey the entrepreneurial value and culture. In contrast to this, a designer creating a logo for a company spends a lot of time collecting and refining information, communicating with clients, repeatedly trying to figure out the core vision of the company, and then thinking a long time to create a kind of symbol to convey its business value. Unprecise keywords, however, neutralize the quality of the logos. Furthermore, even if the user gives a relatively precise keyword, a logo generator creates icons through the approach of a matching process, not a semantic generation. It is impossible to correspond to the semantics of keywords, particularly when an abstract word has been given since the meaning of this kind of word is more difficult to interpret. After the observation of a large number of icons from the dataset at hand, it becomes clear that these icons can accurately express the meaning of concrete words, such as coffee and pigeons. However, abstract vocabulary such as art, creativity and innovation can barely be represented accurately with stored icons. 
There are two possible solutions for this problem. First, the practice of obtaining the keyword could be improved by assigning the keyword search to the perceptron. The logo generator could scan the product catalogue of a company, search for information on the website of a company, and then evaluate the keywords through advanced analysis algorithms. Through this method, more precise keywords could be extracted. Second, the transition from keywords to icons should be improved. The latest deep learning approach, Text2Image, which can convert text into image, might be an innovative breakthrough for this problem. Its generator in GANs (generative adversarial networks) creates pictures according to the text feature from a descriptive text, which is a more intelligent approach than just reflecting data. This way, future Artificial Intelligences might create creative symbols instead of just icons. 

<h5>4.2.2 The Correlation Between Inputs and Outputs is singular</h5>
The second factor responsible for the relatively low quality of logos created by Brandmark is that there are only very few correlations between input layer, hidden layer and output layer. As proven in section 3, the layers mostly have only single connections. One input element determines another output element, e.g., a keyword determines an icon and a color mode affects a color style. This is a rather simple structure, producing results that do not always meet the requirements for a logo as a context symbol. In contrast, when a professional designer creates a logo, the graphic symbol affects font, the semantics of name and keyword have an impact on the color and the layout interacts with all other elements, creating a strong symbolic representation. This interaction between the logo elements is of high significance. Therefore, the number of connections between the layers should be increased. For example, the keyword could determine the font and color and not just the icon. 

<h5>4.2.3 Lack of Quality Evaluation</h5>
The third decisive factor in the low quality of the logos is that the system does not have any approaches for filtering bad logos. The Brandmark website does feature a logo evaluation system called “LogoRank”, which gives users the opportunity to rank logos based on the criteria uniqueness, legibility and contrast (Brandmark.io, 2019). However, this system is not embedded in the generation system. Therefore, it cannot help the generator to improve the quality of logos. But if the developers of Brandmark wish to evaluate and improve the output of logos, they can embed GANs. GANs consist of two different neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner (Mino, and Spanakis, 2019). From the competition, two networks attempt to continually improve their algorithm model for better generation and discrimination. This approach would pave the way to solve the problem of quality and update the process of logo generation. 

<h1 id="section6">5.Conclusion</h1>
<br></br>
Machine learning has mastered the task of creating large amounts of logos in a short time by processing basic parameters provided by the user. However, the quality of such logos is not on par with high quality logos created by professional human designers yet, mainly because of three factors: 
-	inaccuracy of icon creation 
-	singular correlation between inputs and outputs
-	lack of quality in the evaluation 
The quality of logos can be improved by embedding GANs and increasing the connection of convolutional layers.
Machine learning algorithms are capable of discovering complex patterns in the data presented to them, but they are only useful if they have been trained to notice something useful (Hebron, 2016). For this reason, machine learning will continue to rely on the assistance of human designers to better understand the principles of design and the human associations and subtleties that go along with them. In return, in a world of increasing complexity, human designers can profit from the ability of machine learning to handle large amounts of data and to discover complex patterns in provided data, which is one of the most powerful capabilities of machine learning. The full use of machine learning can help designers transform data into insight. 

Design is a bridge to connect user and technology through business applications (Xue, 2019). In order to serve more people, Artificial Intelligence needs to be transformed into mature commercial products or services. Meanwhile, users are also looking forward to the conveniences provided by new technologies. For some fields, there are clear correlations between existing needs and the capability of machine learning systems (Hebron, 2016). Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool. Designers need to think about how to use it appropriately, for the sake of creating more value for clients. Today, with machine learning invading the territory of design, possible extensions to this study may include the discussion of future fields of creative cooperation of design and machine learning that might expand the existing boundaries of design.
